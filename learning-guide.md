## Advice for Mastery
1. **Start Small**:
   - Focus on understanding fundamental concepts like sorting algorithms, recursion, and basic graph traversal.

2. **Consistent Practice**:
   - Solve 2-3 algorithmic problems daily on platforms like LeetCode or Codeforces.
   - Start with easy problems and gradually move to harder ones.

3. **Analyze and Debug**:
   - After solving a problem, analyze your approach, and understand why it works.
   - Debug your solution to catch edge cases and optimize its efficiency.

4. **Learn From Mistakes**:
   - If stuck, read solutions and learn alternate approaches. Reflect on what you missed.

5. **Implement Algorithms**:
   - Write code for standard algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra, and Knapsack from scratch.

6. **Focus on Optimization**:
   - Always aim to reduce time and space complexity while maintaining clarity.
